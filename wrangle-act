# Wrangling Report

Below I’m listing tidiness and quality issues, that were found in the dataset, and the wrangling actions taken to fix each issue. 

## Tidiness Issues and Actions
1. All three dataframes belong to a single observational unit and they should be merged into a single dataframe. **Action:** merged into a single dataframe "twitter_archive_master”.
2. The 4 different columns doggo, floofer, pupper and puppo, are all representation of the same variable that identifies the stage of dog. Therefore they should be merged in a single column. **Action:** merged into a single column “dog_stage”.

## Quality Issues and Actions
1. tweet id columns have wrong dtype. They should be str. **Action:** fixed
2. Two unrelated columns: (Unamed: 17 and Unamed:18). **Action:** dropped.
3. Unrelative columns that start with "retweet_" since the dataset doesn't include retweets. **Action:** dropped.
4. non-informative column such as rating_denominator. **Action:** dropped.
5. wrong entries in dog_stage column. **Action:** converted to NaN.
6. in_reply_to_status_id and in_reply_to_user_id coulmns full of missing values. **Action:** dropped.
7. replace tweet_id column values (wrong enteries) in twitter_archive_master_df with values from id column in tweet_df . **Action:** fixed.
8. rating_numerator column has several quality issues: There are values that are not correctly extracted, out of range values and wrong data type. **Action:** correct values from the tweets are extracted correctly and replaced the old ones. Rows with out of range values are dropped. “str” data type is converted to “float”.
